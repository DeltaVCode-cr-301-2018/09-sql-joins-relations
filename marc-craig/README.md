# Project Name

**Author**: Craig and Marc
**Version**: 1.0.9

## Overview
- Today we utilized SQL queries to join data from articles and authors tables on the author_id value 
- We wrote a SQL query to create a new article. We did this through 3 statements: (1) insert an author and pass the author and author_url as data, (2) retrieve a single author from the authors table. Add the author name as data, and (3) insert the new article using the author_id from the second query, adding the data from the new article, including the author_id
- We wrote a SQL query to update an author record and article record. We did this through 2 statements: (1) Update the author, and (2) Update an article record.
